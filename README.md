A tool to find grammar patterns in Chinese text

# Running the Stanford server
This project requires the Stanford CoreNLP server to be running with Chinese enabled. The easiest way to do this is to use a pre-built docker image. The following command will bring up an Stanford CoreNLP server on port 9000 of your local computer: `docker run -p 9000:9000 --memory=4g skywidesoft/corenlp-chinese:3.7.0`
